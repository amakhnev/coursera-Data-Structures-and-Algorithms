# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository will contain my work from the [Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures) that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through edX. I will be implementing solutions in Java.

## About This program

This MicroMasters program is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems through implementing over one hundred algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice.

No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we have invested thousands of hours designing challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. We believe in learning through application, especially when it comes to learning algorithms.

For each algorithm you develop and implement, we have designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time â€” you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming.
